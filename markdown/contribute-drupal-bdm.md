## Reviewers

What does a reviewer have to do?

- Test
- Code review
- Improve the patch

Most important:

- Protect the committers' time

## Example: restructure

From [Comment #80](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2991207#comment-13282385)
on #2991207:

> I would like to see the class of helper functions replaced with something
> more object-oriented: ...

(`@benjifisher`)

## Example: protect committers' time

From [#3110186](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3110186):

- `@xjm` (#58): `Issue tags: +needs followup`<br>
  ...
  I think there's some refactoring that should maybe be done, but that also would be a followup.

- `@benjifisher` (#61): `Issue tags: -needs followup`<br>
  I added #3117157: ...

- `@xjm` (#62): Perfect, thanks `@benjifisher`!
